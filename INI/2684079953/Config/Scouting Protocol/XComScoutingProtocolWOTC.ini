; Values for Scouting Protocol.
; These are mostly defaults, but it's now turn-ending and can be used once every other turn so it doesn't make Specialists better scouts than Shinobis are.
; This ability is only for GREMLINs, not BITs, to allow the GREMLINs to compete better with BITs' heavy weapon slot.
