; Disposable launchers will no longer debuff stealth
; However, carrying one will reduce mobility by 2 (handled in XComLW_Overhaul.ini) and the mobility penalty will not leave after firing the rocket
; Tier 2 and 3 launchers get a damage buff
; These can now only be equipped in a utility slot, not heavy or secondary slots, which means SPARKs and MEC Troopers can no longer use them
; They can be equipped alongside grenades, but each soldier can only carry one of the launchers
