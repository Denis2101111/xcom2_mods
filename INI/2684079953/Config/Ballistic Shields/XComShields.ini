; This adds a 1-turn cooldown to Shield Bash, but only for SPARKs and MEC Troopers, since they deal a stun with their bash instead of just a disorient.
; Specifically it will apply to any unit with the MecTrooperImmunities or Overdrive abilities.
; Change the 1 to 0 if you don't want the cooldown, and ensure to not complain to me about using Shield Bash 3 times in a turn with Overdrive being OP.
