; Kiruka's note: only standard Titan Armor is in Mod Jam, not the Grand Titan Armor.
; Before you start throwing full wine bottles at your computer screens, chill out, there WILL be a "Tier 5" armor included in Mod Jam at a later date.
; We're also gonna buff the Titan Armor's HP a bit since Warden Armor in LWOTC already grants 8 HP
; Titan Strike now does a point of Rupture to make it stand out a little more.
