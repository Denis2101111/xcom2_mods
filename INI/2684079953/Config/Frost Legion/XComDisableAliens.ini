; This file is going to be used to disable specific Frost Legion units until some of the related bugs get fixed.
; I have no ETA on the bug fixes.
; You can comment out whichever line(s) you want under the header to re-enable the unit(s) in question if you want to mess around and test stuff.
; If you choose to re-enable one or more of these and then encounter the extra bugs I'm already listing here, I don't want to hear about it.
; I especially don't want to be pinged about it on Discord by some goddamn muppet who can't read.
; Your best bet for getting an actual fix for these bugs at some point is to report them to Mitzruti, who made the Frost Legion mod and is a much better coder than me.
; If fixes do happen, I DO want to hear about that, so I can re-enable the relevant unit(s) in here.

;+DisableAlien=FrostAndromedon ; These guys are not properly hackable for some reason. Only slightly yabai. They otherwise work. I personally would still leave them disabled for now.
; Update: Mitzruti has apparently fixed the above issue. Let me know if it comes back.
+DisableAlien=FrostBruiser_M2
+DisableAlien=FrostBruiser_M3 ; These guys are BIG YABAI right now. Removing the Ice Shield ability from them breaks their health bar, and firing Overwatch shots at them for some reason locks up the game. I highly recommend leaving them disabled for now.
+DisableAlien=FrostDroidShield_M2
+DisableAlien=FrostDroidShield_M3 ; These guys have the same issue as the Frost Bruiser's broken health bar one. Not sure whether the Overwatch issue affects them. Let's go with "yabai", and I recommend leaving them disabled for now.
+DisableAlien=FrostChryssalidW_M1
+DisableAlien=FrostChryssalidW_M2
+DisableAlien=FrostChryssalidW_M3
+DisableAlien=FrostChryssalidB_M1
+DisableAlien=FrostChryssalidB_M2
+DisableAlien=FrostChryssalidB_M3 ; BIG YABAI. Similar Ice Shield removal issue, and also the standard variant (not the Bleeder) will lock up the game if you damage them with gunfire or explosives. I highly recommend leaving them disabled for now.
+DisableAlien=FrostMEC_M3 ; Apparently these guys, this tier specifically, spawns already dead, and you don't get loot from it either.
+DisableAlien=FrostDroid_M3 ; Spawning with Ice Shields for some reason
