; This will make the two KSM variants' Kinetic Strike ability a non-turn-ending action if used by a particularly melee-inclined unit (a SPARK with Assault Servos (Mechatronic Warfare), a MEC Assault, or a MEC Skirmisher)
; Also ensures that it does not end the turn when a SPARK is using Overdrive
; This is basically a reference to that one upgrade MEC Troopers could get in Enemy Within that did the same thing
