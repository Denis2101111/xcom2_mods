;	ELECTRO PULSE: IRI_ElectroPulse_CV
;	----------------------------------

; This thing is being changed to behave more like it did in LW1, although it will still do more damage to robots than organics. No more hack defense debuff or emptying enemy weapons.
; Handle costs in XComLW_Overhail.ini. By default, they have gone up as Electro Pulse is no longer limited by charges and has the same radius it did in LW1.
