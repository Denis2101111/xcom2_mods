[ModJamLWOTC_M2.GrantWeaponWithAbility]
; This controls which weapon categories a soldier gains access to with certain skills.
; Right now its purpose is to grant Psionics Overhaul's Psions access to the gear that normally would be restricted to specific classes (e.g. Psi Operatives)
; This is only for weapons. If you want something to handle Psi PCS, get my Cut Content Psionics For LWOTC mod.
