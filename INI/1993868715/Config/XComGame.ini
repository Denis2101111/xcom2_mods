[ABBPerkPack.OPTC_VoltaicArc]
; This reworks the Voltaic Arc ability from Mitzruti's Perk Pack to only trigger on enemy movement, and only when it's not XCOM's turn.
; This will make it more balanced in the LWOTC environment which often has a lot more enemies.
; Change TRUE to FALSE if you don't want this feature.
