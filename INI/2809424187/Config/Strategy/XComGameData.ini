; Tactical cost of using strikes
; TODO: Turn into templates that can be accessed in both tactical and strategic layers, and as unlocks for mission/covert action rewards
;

;
; GTSTemplate:			The template name of the GTS Unlock in question.
; Category:				Category that the support strike falls under.
; ItemToGive:			The item(weapon) that will be given to the soldiers
; AbilityTemplateName:	This ability template will have scaled costs for intel
; Stike Cost:			Strategic requirements to use the strike

; Cost is determined by the following definitions:
; Usage:				This value is determined by the number of times the player has called the ability associated with the strike data.
;						The Usage value is capped by MaximumCap.
; Multiplier:			Cost is multiplied by this number the more you use this ability
; Addition:				Cost is added by this number the more you use this ability (Is multipled by usage)
; MaximumCap:			Number of strikes before the cost stops scaling by the Multiplier and Addition
;		Example
;			Consider these values: 
;				Intel Cost: 100
;				Multiplier: 1.0f 
;				Addition: 10
;			Base Intel Cost + (Base Intel Cost x (Multiplier * Current Usage)) + (Addition * Current Usage))
;			0 uses: 100 + (100 x ((1.0 * (0)) + (10 * (0)) = 100 Intel
;			1 uses: 100 + (100 x ((1.0 * (1)) + (10 * (1)) = 210 Intel
;			2 uses: 100 + (100 x ((1.0 * (2)) + (10 * (2)) = 320 Intel
;			3 uses: 100 + (100 x ((1.0 * (3)) + (10 * (3)) = 430 Intel
