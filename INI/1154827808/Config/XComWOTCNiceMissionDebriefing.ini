;	Nice Mission Debriefing will try to automatically detect abilities that work similar to the Standard Shot.
;	If a particular ability is not getting caught, you can add it like this:
;+basicShotAbilities="StandardShot"

;	Set to "true" to enable debug logging into Launch.log file.
;	This will spam a lot, so preferable to keep it disabled unless you're actively debugging an issue.
