; ==================== OPTIONAL FEATURE ====================

; Skip narratives with a certain string in their SoundCue name. This can be used to surgically remove specific narratives 
; 	or remove all narratives from specific NPCs. These exclusions will be checked first, before the mod options are checked. 
; **Put the entries in your XComNarrativeControl_Settings.ini file**. 

; The 'StrategyNarrativesToSkip' array takes these values. They can be added in any order:
;		Exclude - If this string is found in the SoundCue name, do not play the narrative
;		SoundPath - If this string is found in the SoundCue path, do not play the narrative
;		Include - If this string is found in the SoundCue name, play the narrative (regardless of other settings)

; Examples:

;; Remove all of Betos's narratives
; StrategyNarrativesToSkip=(SoundPath="XPACK_SoundSpeechStrategyBetos")

;; Remove all of Shen's narratives, but still play ambient narratives
; StrategyNarrativesToSkip=(SoundPath="SoundSpeechStrategyShen",Include="Ambient")

;; Only remove the narratives from Central Officer Bradford that occur when the Avatar Project advances
; StrategyNarrativesToSkip=(Exclude="Doom",SoundPath="SoundSpeechStrategyCentral")
; StrategyNarrativesToSkip=(Exclude="Advent_Progress",SoundPath="SoundSpeechStrategyCentral")
; StrategyNarrativesToSkip=(Exclude="Facilities_Constructed",SoundPath="SoundSpeechStrategyCentral")
; StrategyNarrativesToSkip=(Exclude="Final_Avatar_Countdown",SoundPath="SoundSpeechStrategyCentral")
