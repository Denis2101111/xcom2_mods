; Note: since accessing base game classes is sometimes a huge pain due to many things being private and protected, in some cases you will need to change values
; inside two different configuration files: this file and XComCamera.ini. And yes, I hate it myself.

[FreeCameraRotation.XComTacticalInput_FreeCameraRotation]
CAMERA_ROTATION_FIXED=45.0f		; deg per key press
CAMERA_ROTATION_SPEED=180.0f	; deg per second. For rortation to be smooth you need to match MaximumInterpolationRotationPerSecond value (in XComCamera.ini) to this one.
CAMERA_ZOOM_SPEED=1.0f			; zoom factor per second. For zooming to be smooth you need to match MaximumInterpolationZoomPerSecond value (in XComCamera.ini) to this one.
bAnalogMode=false				; enable analog mode (starting mode, can be switched on and off in-game)

[FreeCameraRotation.X2Camera_FollowMouseCursor_FreeCameraRotation]
MIN_ZOOM_MULT=-0.25f			; min allowed zoom multiplier is used to limit zoom in factor as ZoomedDistanceFromCursor (in XComCamera.ini) affects both zoom in and zoom out and big ZoomedDistanceFromCursor values tend to break zoom in.
;ZoomedDistanceFromCursor and DistanceFromCursor are defined in XComCamera.ini (to affect all cameras and avoid zoom jittering when the game is switching between different cameras).
