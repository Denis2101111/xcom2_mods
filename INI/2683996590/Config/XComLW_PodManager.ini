[LW_Overhaul.XComGameState_LWPodManager]

; POD JOBS
;
; The pod job system replaces most of the basic pod mechanics. The following have all been disabled:
;
; downthrottling - moves pods away from you when engaged
; upthrottling - moves pods between you and the objective when you have been inactive for several turns
; interception - moves pods directly to you if you cross their "encounter zone" without activating them
;
; The pod job system doesn't replace the per-unit AI or job system (AIJobs) that dictates how units react 
; to alerts. This sytem is a mechanism to introduce new alerts into the game to change pod behaviors when
; they are not active.
;
; The pod job system begins all missions inactive. The system engages when both XCOM is not in squad
; concealment *and* at least one pod has entered red or yellow alert.
;
; Jobs are defined with the MissionJobs config, and can contain the following options that control when
; the job is considered available and which pods may fill it:
;
;  MinTurn (int)      - The minimum number of turns that need to pass since the system activates for 
;                       this job to become available. 
;                       Default: -1 (no minimum turn)
;  MaxTurn (int)      - Corresponds to MinTurn, the maximum number of turns since activation. 
;                       Default: -1 (no maximum turn)
;  MinSize (int)      - A pod must contain at least MinSize members to be eligible for this job.
;                       Default: -1 (no minimum size)
;  MaxSize (int)      - A pod may contain no more than MaxSize members to be eligible for this job.
;                       Default: -1 (no maximum size)
;  MinEngagedAI (int) - At least this number of enemies must be active for this job to be considered.
;                       Default: -1 (no min active count)
;  MaxEngagedAI (int) - No more than this number of enemies can be active for this job to be considered.
;                       Default: -1 (no max active count)
;  Cooldown (int)     - After this job completes it cannot be chosen again until this number of turns
;                       have passed. Jobs are considered complete when a pod activates or based on per-job
;                       criteria (usually: they've reached their destination).
;                       Default: -1 (no cooldown) 
;  RequireGuardPods (bool) -
;                       If true, only pods with a PatrolWidth of < 10 will be eligible for this job. These
;                       pods are listed as (Guard) in the debug screen and generally do not patrol.
;                       Default: false (any pod will be eligible to take jobs)
;  AllowGuardPods (bool) - 
;                       If true, pods with a PatrolWidth of < 10 will be eligible for this job. These
;                       pods are listed as (Guard) in the debug screen and generally do not patrol.
;                       Default: false (guard pods will not take jobs)
;  RequireYellowAlert (bool) -
;                       If true, only pods in Yellow Alert will be eligible for this job.
;                       Default: false (yellow and green pods are eligible for jobs)
;  AllowYellowAlert (bool) -
;                       If true, pods in Yellow Alert will be eligible for this job.
;                       Default: false (only green pods will take jobs)
;  Unlimited (bool) -   If true, this job will not be removed from the potential job list when it is assigned
;                       to a pod, allowing more than one pod to take this job. In general this should only be
;                       used with jobs that are restricted in some other way (e.g. only yellow alert pods, or
;                       jobs with only a random chance of being chosen) or with a low priority.
;  RandomChance (float) - 
;                       This job will only be assigned if a random roll from [0, 1.0) is less than the provided
;                       value. A value of "0" is equivalent to "1.0", meaning no random chance.
;                       Default: 0 (= 100%)
;  LeaderAIJob (name) - When this job is assigned the pod leader will be given this AI job.
;                       Default: '' (no AI job assigned)
;  EncounterID (name) - This job will only be assigned to a pod with the matching encounter ID.
;                       Default: '' (any encounter ID can take this job)
;  AlertCause (EAlertCause) -
;                       The provided alert cause will be used on alerts generated for this job. Can be used
;                       to assign an alert of a higher or lower priority.
;                       Default: eAC_ThrottlingBeacon (the standard patrol alert)
;  AlertTag (String) -  The kismet alert tag to assign to the alerts generated by this job. These are used
;                       by certain AI jobs to ensure the units prioritize particular alert locations when
;                       scoring alerts for movement. 
;  Difficulties (array<int>) - 
;                       An array of difficulty values for which this job will be considered.
;                       Default: empty (all difficulties are eligible)
;  IncludedMissionFamilies (array<string>) -
;                       An array of mission family names for which this job will be considered. If present,
;                       this job will only be allowed if the current mission matches an entry.
;                       Default: empty (all mission families are eligible)
;  ExcludedMissionFamilies (array<string>) -
;                       An array of mission family names for which this job will be excluded. If present,
;                       this job will be disabled from those mission families.
;                       Default: empty (no mission families are excluded)
;  Priority (int) -     A value controlling the relative priority of jobs. Jobs with a lower priority value
;                       are assigned first.
;                       Default: 50
;  FriendlyName (string) - 
;                       Debug string. Only appears in \LWDebugPodJobs, used to make jobs identifiable. Not
;                       localized.
;                       Default: empty (job # will be used instead)
;
;
;  And finally:
;
;  Jobs (array<Name>) -
;                       The actual job to assign. The job is chosen randomly from the list of possibilities
;                       if more than one array entry is present.
;                       Default: none
;
; The list of valid jobs is currently:
;
; Guard - Pod will move to the objective
; Block - Pod will attempt to move between the objective and XCOM's last known position. Similar to
;         the "upthrottling" location.
; Intercept - Pod will attempt to move to intercept XCOM at their last known position.
; Flank - Pod will attempt to set up off to the side of XCOM's last known position and then approach
;         from that side.
; Defend - Pod will move to the objective and remain there

; New jobs can be added. See the "XComGameState_LWPodJob" and "LWPodJobTemplate" classes.

; === POD DEFINITIONS

; Catch-all definitions for all mission types. Some turns after XCOM has made contact, assign 
; some pods to some randomized reaction behaviors. Only green alert pods are allowed to get
; these jobs. See below for some additional definitions for pods in yellow alert, and some for
; specific encounter IDs.

;;; YELLOW ALERT JOBS

; The following jobs all require the pod to be in yellow alert. They are all
; 'unlimited' jobs, so any number of pods can take these jobs. These replace
; the default yellow alert behavior of simply running toward the alert as fast
; as possible.
;
; The first set of jobs are for yellow pods that are *not* guard pods. They
; have several random choices at a higher priority (lower number) that can be
; assigned with a random chance, followed by a normal priority catch-all job
; for non-guard yellow pods: intercept xcom.
;
; The second set of jobs are for yellow pods that are guard pods. A similar
; set of logic applies: there are a set of randomly available jobs at a higher
; priority, followed by a normal priority catch-all for guard yellow pods:
; defend the objective.

;;; ENCOUNTER-SPECIFIC JOBS

; The following jobs have specific encounter ID requirements. They are permitted on both yellow and green
; pods, and are tested at a higher priority so they can be assigned before any default jobs. These also
; typically override the default alert cause to force the pod to use this alert location.

; Alert for the Avenger Defense assault teams. In vanilla these were handled by giving the particular
; pods the 'Charger' AI Job. Do the same, with our custom encounter IDs. The actual alert we put on this
; job is irrelevant: the charger AI job will ensure they move to the kismet-provided hostile map alert
; location, which has a higher priority than the default throttling beacon we create for regular jobs.

; 'Defender' AI Job. Do the same with our custom encounter ID. We can override the alert
; cause and alert tag so that the AIJob defender job will target this location instead of
; the hostile map-wide alert which is usually treated as a higher priority than a peaceful
