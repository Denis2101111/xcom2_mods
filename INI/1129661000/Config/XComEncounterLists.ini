; SPAWN DISTRIBUTION LISTS
;
;	ListID : The name of this list
;	SpawnDistribution[X] : An entry to include in the spawn list
;		Template : The template name of the character
;		MinForceLevel : The minimum force level at which this entry can spawn
;		MaxForceLevel : The maximum force level at which this entry can spawn
;		MaxCharactersPerGroup : The maximum number of this template that can spawn in the group (relevant only on follower lists)
;		SpawnWeight : A weighted value for this spawn, all valid spawns have their weights totalled and a random roll selects from within valid choices
;----------------------------------------------------------------

; For the handful of people that were familiar with the inclusion/exclusion lists, we have replaced them with a more powerful spawn distribution list.
;   Previously, the game was basically relying on two spawn lists - leaders and followers - which were defined in the character stats.
;   We migrated data for selecting enemies based on force level to a specifically defined list which can now be set on mission schedules, and overriden by sitreps
;   This allows us to replace the basic force level spread on a per mission basis - if you want a special mission that makes Andromedons appear across all force levels
;   That is now possible.
;
; Additionally, to support extensions and modding, you can define the same list multiple times and the game will automatically merge the separated lists
;	Therefore, you can add a completely new spread of units into any existing list by duplicating the name of that list with extra entries
;
;	E.G -  Adding the following array to your XComEncounterLists.ini in your mod would add this character to the default followers list
;				+SpawnDistributionLists=(ListID="DefaultFollowers", \\
;					SpawnDistribution[0]=(Template="AdvUnicornCavalryM1", MinForceLevel=7, MaxForceLevel=11, MaxCharactersPerGroup=2, SpawnWeight=50), \\
;					SpawnDistribution[1]=(Template="AdvUnicornCavalryM2", MinForceLevel=12, MaxForceLevel=16, MaxCharactersPerGroup=2, SpawnWeight=50), \\
;					SpawnDistribution[2]=(Template="AdvUnicornCavalryM3", MinForceLevel=17, MaxForceLevel=20, MaxCharactersPerGroup=2, SpawnWeight=50), \\
;					)
;
; Another advtange of this system is that when adding a unit to the game, it will not get implicitly included in the spawn rotations.  Previously, if the exclusion lists 
;   were not updated to exclude a new character, that character would appear in the general rotation.
;   With the distribution lists, you must add the unit to the general rotation lists for it to begin appearing.
