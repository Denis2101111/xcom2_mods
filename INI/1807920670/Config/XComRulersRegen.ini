[RulersRegen.OPTC_CharactersRulers]

; If you don't need to specify Health and Armor regen for each Rulers, set FAIR_SHARE to true.
; This mod will try to find every Rulers and apply the modifiers.
FAIR_SHARE=true
REGEN_HEALTH=0.33 ; All Rulers will regen 33% of their HP for your next encounter
REGEN_ARMOR=1.0 ; All Rulers will regen 100% of their armor for your next encounter

; As new Rulers may appear with mods, you can now configure which Ruler should be able to regen as well as its regeneration factors.
; If FAIR_SHARE is set to false we will use individual regenerations options.
; HealthRegen: percentage of health the Ruler should recover between two encounters, default is 0.33 for 33%.
; ArmorRegen: percentage of armor the Ruler should recover between two encounters, default is 1.0 for 100%.
