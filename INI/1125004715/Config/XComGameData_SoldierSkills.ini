REAVE_BASE = 1; 1 shield point when Reave is used. This is also the value used by Consuming Biotics when determining how much shield points other biotic abilities give.

REAVE_BONUS = 50; biotic's psi offense stat is divided by this, so they get 2 extra shield points per reave use with 100 psi

REAVE_BEAM = 2; bonus shield points gained when using a beam-tier amp, the mag-tier bonus doesn't add to this.
