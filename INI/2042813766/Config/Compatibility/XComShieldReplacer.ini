;Ran into a compatibility issue between the Stormrider's Respite ability and NSLW's Energy Shield Overhaul
;Instead of replacing Ballistic Shield HP, it creates one of Energy Shield Overhaul's one-hit shields
;This happens even if a Ballistic Shield is not equipped

;Conduit is behaving weird with Energy Shield Overhaul: it's assigning a shield to unbonded soldiers.
