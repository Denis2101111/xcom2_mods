[WOTCRocketLaunchers.X2Condition_RocketTechLevel]

;	This is a list of launchers that can fire ANY rocket from this mod,
;	assuming they pass the previous two conditions.
;	In addition to this global list, each rocket has its own array of Rocket Launchers it can be fired from.
;	This is done so that Rocket Launchers from other mods can decide whether they too can fire all rocket types,
;	or only specific rockets.
