;by default, a character pool soldier can only be used by this mod if they have bothered Can Be Soldier and Can Be Dark VIP tagged. If you want to expand that though...

SoldiersOnly = false; //set this to true so units tagged as only soldiers can be used
DarkVIPsOnly = true; //set this to true so units tagged as only Dark VIPs can be used

UseEntireAppearance = true; //set this to true if  you want looks determined entirely by a character's appearance in the character pool
