;	Examples on adding UB attachments to a weapon

;	The bare minimum that you have to do is to specify weapon template name. This will add all six Underbarrel Attachments for one weapon at the same time.
;	These instructions will help you find template names for various weapons: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1517938486/1735465524703732640/

;	Specify offset for the UB attachments to adjust the position of the attachments' on the weapon.
;	If not specified, zero offset is used.

;+WEAPONS_TO_ADD_ATTACHMENTS=(TEMPLATE=BeowulfRifle_CV, OFFSET_X=10, OFFSET_Y=10, OFFSET_Z=10)


;	You probably will never need it, but you can use a different bone as the basis for the 'underbarrel' socket added by this mod. 
;	If not specified, 'root' bone is used.

;+WEAPONS_TO_ADD_ATTACHMENTS=(TEMPLATE=BeowulfRifle_CV, BONE=mag)


;	You can hide other attachments from specified sockets, in case they would interfere with the positioning for the UB attachment
;	For example, this is necessary for Beam Assault Rifles, as they have a flashlight where the UB attachment is supposed to be.

;+WEAPONS_TO_ADD_ATTACHMENTS=(TEMPLATE=BeowulfRifle_CV, SOCKETS_TO_HIDE[0]=Light, SOCKETS_TO_HIDE[1]=Trigger,SOCKETS_TO_HIDE[2]=Suppressor)

;	Attachments can be added one at a time.
;	This method is useful in two cases: 
;	(1) when different attachments require invividual positioning. Then you add several sockets through XComWeaponSkinReplacer.ini and use different sockets for different attachments.
;	Note that there will be only one socket for firing projectiles, determind by OFFSETs specified in WEAPONS_TO_ADD_ATTACHMENTS that was listed last for the specific weapon, 
;	so you should not put different attachments too far from each other, or the firing will look weird in game.
;	(2) for modders who want to use their own custom models for underbarrel attachments. In which case, they can just create and empty mod/addon with a .UPK with their assets and a XComUnderbarrel.ini to configure their attachment.
;	TYPE must be either UBGL or UBS. 
;	TIER can be CV, MG or BM. This is the tier of the attachment that you are adding to the weapon, it will determine attachment's default model and weapon stats.
;	MESH, IMG1 and IMG2 can be left unspecified, in which case the default mesh and images for that tier will be used.
;	SOCKET can be left unspecified, in which case the default 'underbarrel' socket will be used.
