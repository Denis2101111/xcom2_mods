showSplitTeamsActive=true

; Set to show split counts for killed enemies per team
showSplitTeamsKilled=true

; Setting this to true will never show you the total number of enemies in a mission, even when you have access to the ShadowChamber so you already know it.
neverShowEnemyTotal=false

; The exact oposit from above - set it to true and you'll get the enemies total always even though you havn't build the ShadowChamber yet.
; Please note that this outrules the setting from above - this one takes precendence, always.
alwaysShowEnemyTotal=false

; Set it to true and you'll get the enemies total always even though you havn't build the ShadowChamber yet, as long as Location Scout is active

; As turrets don't count into the 'total enemies killed' at the end of the mission, we don't include them here as well by default. If you like, you can enable counting them.

; General notice: The UI consists of a surrounding (invisible) 'box' which is anchored to the screen. 
; This 'box' is filled by the actual 'textbox'. When the 'box' is spawned, the upper left corner is placed at the chosen Anchor. 
; This is why the 'box' is by default (anchored to the TOP_RIGHT) by -620 on the X axis and 50 on the Y axis. 
; The 'box' itself is currently 600*150 (X*Y).

; How the text is aligned witin the 'box'.
; Possible values: RIGHT, LEFT, CENTER
