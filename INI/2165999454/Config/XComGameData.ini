;;	YOU CAN ADJUST BASE SPARK HEALING RATE TO ACCOUNT FOR HAVING UPTO 6 SLOTS OF SPARKS ALL HEALING AT ONCE
;;	AND ENCOURAGE MORE SPARKS IN GENERAL IN PLAY, HEALING RATE IS KINDA MOOT AS THEY CAN GO ON MISSIONS INJURED
;;		A LONGER HEAL TIME SHOULD LEAD TO MORE DAMAGE ACCRUED AND THUS RISKY PLAY TO KEEP SENDING THEM OUT DAMAGED
;;		A SHORTER TIMER SHOULD LEAD TO BE ABLE TO REPAIR MORE SPARKS IN THE SAME TIMEFRAME

;FOR INFO ONLY -- Rates are not difficulty adjusted, adjusted wound times instead
;   DEFAULT SOLDIER HEAL RATES  -- XComHeadquarters_BaseHealRates=80 
;   DEFAULT SPARK HEAL RATES    -- BaseSparkHealRate=80
;
;   DUE TO THE NEW HEALING CALCULATION BASED ON NUMBER OF SPARK SLOTS OPEN THE RATE HERE IS REDUCED INITIALLY BY A FACTOR OF 3
;   THE NEW HEALING RATE CALCULATION IS [BASESPARKHEALRATE] X [NUMBER OF UNLOCKED SLOTS +1]
;   SO BEGINNING OF THE GAME WITH 2 UNLOCKED SLOTS THE RATE IS BASESPARKHEALRATE X 3, OR 40x3 = 120
;   WITH A FULL 6 SLOTS THE HEALING RATE IS BASESPARKHEALRATE X 7 , OR 40x7 = 280

-BaseSparkHealRate=80
+BaseSparkHealRate=40

;Part of this mods fixes for MW/MOF Spark DataCores
