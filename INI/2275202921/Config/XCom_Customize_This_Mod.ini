;;	PURPOSE: Users, Use this file to adjust configurations to the mod :)

; ***** Kiruka's notes *****
; You can tweak stats and stuff for all of the currently released Advent Armors in this one ini file, other than my Pathfinder Armor and Pathfinder Hunter Armor (unless you add them of course)
; I don't care much about the schematics costs here, I'm just eyeballing them, they aren't used in LWOTC anyway
; Most of these armors are enticing alternatives to Predator or possibly even Warden depending on your playstyle, but are balanced by LWOTC's corpse economy
; Don't complain to me about "unbalanced" if you use mods that aren't balanced themselves in the LWOTC setting like Extract Corpses
; If you're using this mod without LWOTC, each schematic will grant infinite copies, and they will not be sellable for anything in the Black Market

; Offers a good health bonus but no armor. No longer grants the extra utility slot (LWOTC already lets soldiers have 3 utility slots each), but grants the Mark Target ability. If you're also subscribed to my Buildable Units mod, Mark Target can be used without breaking concealment and has a more sensible localization.
