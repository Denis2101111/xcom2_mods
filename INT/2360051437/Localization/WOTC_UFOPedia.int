DescriptionEntry = "A mysterious new branch of study for XCOM, the Psionics utilize their mental abilities to great effect to boosting their allies and crippling the will of enemies.\n\nXCOM's Psionics are trained in various methods to utilise the ADVENT psionic network. Most people will need to use Psionic Amplifiers but there are stories of those that do not. One such famous example was that of Annette Durand, whose psionic awakening and gifts manifested shortly after the invasion began, before the collapse of humanity to the Elders. No-one knows if she really even existed.\n\nMany believe that the human genetic code for holding Psionic powers is something the Elders are greatly interested in. People with 'The Gift' are often taken away by ADVENT peacekeepers when they are identified. We are lucky to have some recuited within XCOM and not snatched into the followings of Geist and the Templar order.\n\nThe skills an adept Psionic can conjure range from simple telekinesis to outright mind-controlling domination. Are these powers too much? Who knows.\n\nMany claim this is magic, some believe it to be technological prowess - but surely any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
