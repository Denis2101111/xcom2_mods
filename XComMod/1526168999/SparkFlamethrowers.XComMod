Title=[WOTC]SPARK Flamethrowers
Description=This mod adds a new weapon type for SPARKs with all 3 tiers, Spark Flamethrowers have 3 fire modes, a standard flamethrower attack, a grenade attack and a beam attack.\n\n[h1]WHAT IS IN THIS MOD:[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] New weapon type complete with all 3 technology tier variants. [/list] \n\n[h1]INFO:[/h1]\n\n[b]SPARK Flamethrowers[/b]\n\nSPARK flamethrowers have 3 different fire modes, the standard flamethrower attack uses a single ammo point, and the damage as a lot of spread, for example, the Inferno Cannon(which is the conventional tier of the flamethrowers) will deal between 2 to 6 damage, meaning that if you use it on a bunch of advent troopers, it could outright kill some, but only wound others. The second fire mode, is a grenade like ability, it deals a flat ammount of damage, utilizes 2 ammo, and has 2 charges(meaning you can only use it twice per mission), and the range and radius of the grenade increases with each tier of weapon. The final fire mode is a beam attack which utilizes the entire pool of ammo, it has increase accurracy the closer you are to your target, it deals a flat ammount of damage but it also pierces and shreds armor.\nAlso fyi all 3 tiers deal pure fire damage, so it's going to be useless against any enemy that is inmune to fire damage.\n\n[b]How to obtain them:[/b]\n\nFirst you must complete the Purifier autopsy, once you have completed the Purifier autopsy a second research will appear for "Spark Flamethrowers" and after completing the Spark Flamethrowers research you will be able to build the Inferno Cannon in the proving grounds.\nThe Flamestorm Cannon will appear in the proving grounds after building the Inferno Cannon and completing the Gauss weapons research.\nThe Apocalypse Cannon which is the final tier for the SPARK flamethrowers will appear in the proving grounds after building one flamestorm cannon and completing the Heavy Plasma Research.\n\n[h1]KNOWN ISSUES:[/h1]\n\nDuring testing i encontered 2 issues, the first one is a vanilla issue although personally i have never encountered it until now. It seems to be that when a fire weapon tries to "apply fire to the world" to tiles with water, the game will crash. I was able to reproduce this issue a couple of times and i was able to reproduce it using the normal fire grenade, the purifier flamethrower and grenade, and the vanilla flamethrower heavy weapons. So my only advice is to try and not target water with these weapons, although sometimes it didn't crash the game when i did. tl;dr: Exercise caution.\nThe second issue i hope just goes away magically during standard play, but whenever i tested the weapon it would start with 1 ammo out of 3, i asked around and my theory is that it has something to do with trying the weapon in debug tactical. Unfortunately if the problem persists i don't have the faintest clue what could cause it.\n\n[h1]COMPATIBILITY:[/h1]\n\nAs far as i'm aware this mod should be compatible with everything as it only adds new weapons that are classified as "Spark Rifles."\n\n[h1]FAQ:[/h1]\n\n[b]Do i need to start a new campaign for this?[/b]\n\nIt should, but if you want to be on the safe side make sure it's a new campaign. Also general reminder to nuke your .inis in yourdocuments before you start a new campaign.\n\n[b]Can i edit X in the .inis?[/b]\n\nPretty much every stat and value should be configurable in the .ini file. There is only one, XcomFLAMEData.ini.\n\n[h1]PERMISSIONS:[/h1]\n\nYou are free to use anything and everything in this mod for your own mods and/or purposes, in fact not only are you allowed, i encourage you to do it.\n\n[h1]PATREON:[/h1]\n\nIf you wish to keep up with early previews, updates or simply wish to support me in some way i have set up a Patreon.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Claus\n\nThanks, and hope you enjoy.
