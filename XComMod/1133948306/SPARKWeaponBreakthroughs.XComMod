Title=SPARK Weapon Breakthroughs
Description=SPARKs are actually pretty great by themselves in War of the Chosen: they don't really need much more in terms of buffs (honestly I kinda regret making Metal over Flesh Redux), but I feel like breakthroughs are the one exception to that.
RequiresXPACK=true

tags= gameplay, war of the chosen
