Has the same range as the standard shotguns, deals 4 damage per shot, and it has 5 crit damage.\n[*] [h1]Metion Burst Fire Ability:[/h1] The weapon fires 3 shots in a row, each shot has a bigger aim penalty than the last(-10, -15, -20, respectively), it takes 1 action point to fire and it does not consume all action points upon use, all this is configurable in the .ini.[/list] \n\n[b]How to obtain them:[/b]\n\nComplete the Gauss Weapons research, and the Andromedon Autopsy, you can build the weapon afterwards in the Proving Grounds where it takes 140 supplies, 20 alloys, 5 elerium, and a single Elerium core.
