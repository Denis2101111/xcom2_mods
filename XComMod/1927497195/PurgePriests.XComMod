Title=[WoTC] Purge Priests
Description=This mod adds four new Advent enemies, the Purge Priest, Purge Bishop, Exalted Purge Bishop and the Exalted Purge Archbishop. These Advent use a short range "purge gun" which deals fire damage and can set targets on fire, they also have a psionic ability which can immobilize your soldiers, a fire variant of the Templar's Volt ability, and the Exalted variants have fire based AoE abilities and an AoE variant of their immobilizing ability. The Exalted Purge Archbishop is also a "Boss Pod" like Sectopods, and Gatekeepers.\n\n[h1]WHAT IS IN THIS MOD:[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] 4 New Advent Enemies.[/list] \n\n[h1]INFO:[/h1]\n\n[b]Purge Priest[/b]\n\nPurge Priests are equipped with a purge gun, a short range fire weapon, and can cast "purge bolt", a fire based variant of the Templar's volt, which can hit up to 3 targets.\n\n[b]Purge Bishop[/b]\n\nPurge Bishops are a higher tier variant of the Purge Priest, they have higher stats and have an additional ability, "Jail" which can immobilize a single enemy for the duration of a turn, their Purge Bolt can hit up to 4 targets.\n\n[b]Exalted Purge Bishop[/b]\n\nExalted Purge Bishops are a higher tier variant of the Purge Bishop, they have higher stats and have an additional ability, their "Jail" ability is replaced by "Mass Jail" which allows them to immobilize multiple soldiers at the same time, their final ability "Blazing Storm" is a huge fire based AoE attack. Finally, their Purge Bolt attack can hit up to 5 targets.\n\n[b]Exalted Purge Archbishop[/b]\n\nThe Exalted Purge Archbishop is a "boss" enemy, boasting much higher stats than their lesser counterparts, their purge bolt(now renamed "purge cascade" because it sounds cool) can hit up to 6 targets, Melting Stream the upgraded variant of Blazing Storm has a much narrower AoE but deals more damage, shred more, and causes panic. They also retain Mass Jail and have a couple of defensive passive abilities, i wont ruin the surprise but i would suggest you use Robojumper's "Another F1" mod.\n\n[h1]KNOWN ISSUES:[/h1]\n\nThis only happened twice during many tests, but when my soldiers got "Jailed" those two times they couldn't do anything, which is not the intended effect, Jail is not stasis, it is just a mobility debuff(-100) that stops your soldiers from running, but they should still be able to do anything else. If this happens to you, it seems to fix itself if you save and load the game.\n\n[h1]COMPATIBILITY:[/h1]\n\nUsually i say "it should be compatible with everything", but then it turns out it isn't, so if you find any compatibility issues let me know.\n\n[h1]FAQ:[/h1]\n\nAre there any tech rewards for killing these dudes?\n\nNo. I might revisit the mod in the future but no promises.\n\nCosmetics?\n\nNope, to be perfectly honest i always think it's a bit of a pain to make cosmetics for the alien mods i've made in the past, however in the case of these dudes, it's even more of a pain because i would also have to edit the Advent Priest's armor.\n\nDo i need to start a new campaign for these dudes?\n\nJust in case i'm going to say "yes", can never be too careful.\n\n[h1]To-do list:[/h1]\n\nReveal animations, i hesitated to release the mod without them but i realized it would take some time to make them look good, so i decided to just release the mod without them. Right now they have the standard Priest reveal animations.\n\n[h1]PERMISSIONS:[/h1]\n\nYou are free to use anything and everything in this mod for your own mods and/or purposes, in fact not only are you allowed, i encourage you to do it.\n\n[h1]PATREON:[/h1]\n\nIf you wish to keep up with early previews, updates or simply wish to support me in someway i have set up a Patreon.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Claus\n\nThanks, and hope you enjoy.\nAs always make sure you post any issues you find in the Bug Report discussion.
